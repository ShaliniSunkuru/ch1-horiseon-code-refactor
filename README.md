# Horiseon Code Refactor

## Description

The code for the Horiseon website was refactored to increase the quality and accessibility of the website. 

The purpose that this code refactor served was to make the website better accessible by everyone including screen readers and to  enhance the search-engine-optimisation rankings of the website. 

This was achieved by following the below user story and acceptance criteria closely and making improvemnents in the HTML and CSS files on Visual Studio Code while using Github to update and maintain versions of code on this Git repository (ch1-horiseon-code-refactor).
